Right now in package.json we have only 2 dependencies:
- React
- React-DOM

We need more, so install the following:
- Redux
- React Router DOM
- Appwrite
- TinyMCE
- html react parser
- react hook form

We will install all at once here (We can install them individually too).

Environment Variables:

In react, we use JavaScript which is a browser language. Data is fetched from JS to browser. But sometimes, when we work with data, we use some sort of environment variables which are "generated by the system". Why does this happen?

It happens because the system does not want the database credentials to be public, so that it can be misused and let others extract sensitive information from it.

Hence, these are also stored in a different manner, both in the editor and in the browser.

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ Keep the environment variables always in the projects' root directory.

Root directory, it is the level in which we have package.json and readme files.

App.css is inside the src directory and not in the root directory.

Root Directory = Home Directory

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ In the root directory, make a file named ".env".

'.' is very important here.

// 2. Go to .env now
