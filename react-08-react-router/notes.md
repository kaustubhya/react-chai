[Header.jsx code explaination:](https://chat.openai.com/c/20cd2cf5-c198-4004-81fd-035d92be69d2)

Footer.jsx code:
 <span className="sr-only">Dribbble account</span>

{/* In the context of your code, the <span> element with the sr-only class contains the text "Dribbble account," serving as a textual label or description for the Dribbble icon. While this text is visually hidden, it will be read aloud by screen readers, enhancing the accessibility of the website for users who rely on these assistive technologies. The idea is to provide a meaningful description of the icon that might not be apparent from its visual representation alone. */}
